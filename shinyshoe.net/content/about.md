title: "About Me"

#### Background
I'm an IT engineer with a strong specialization in networking, currently working toward earning professional certifications to deepen my expertise. Iâ€™m deeply passionate about digital privacy and self-hosting, and I actively build and manage my own infrastructure to maintain control over my data.

I have hands-on experience in setting up and maintaining servers, including containerized environments using Docker. I often develop in C++ and Bash, occasionally working with Java and, more rarely, Python. My interests also extend into parallel programming, particularly with SYCL, where I explore performance optimization in parallel or GPU-accelerated environments.

#### Hardware Proficiency
Beyond software, I enjoy working with hardware, especially Arduino for some DIY and automation projects. I have done many projects that utilize arduino mainly for IoT, remote-control, and remote-monitoring. In my past, I have also done electric related projects like tesla coils and marx generators. I have a slight interest in high voltage stuff, mostly safe stuff tho. Although, some of this project backfired and sent high EMP pulses through my devices but we don't need to talk about that...

In terms of the "pc" hardware, I have maintained and fixed several computers in my past. In terms of knowledge, I'd say I have slightly above average computer knowledge, but definitely not an expert.

#### Non Nerdy Intrests
Other than all of that nerdy stuff, I'm also fascinated by astrophysics. Growing up as a child, I was always fascinated by the science behind our universe. I spent a lot of my free time watching and researching astrophysics. Sometimes I also look into raw data captured by space telescopes and try to process them myself, mostly for curiosity.

Other than astrophysics, I also like photography/cinematography. I have my very own DSLR camera, a D5200 Nikon camera. Mostly I do nature photography but on some occasions, I also do some event photography(mostly because someone else wants photos from these events :P).

#### Nerdy Interests
Quantum computing and cryptography are areas that excite me both intellectually and practically. I'm constantly exploring their potential implications for security and computation. Even though I'm bad at it, I try to include as much cryptography in all of my work. Somehow I will spent hours trying to protect a communication between two private servers.

I don't know if this is masochism but I love solving problems. That doesn't mean I'm good at it though, I just love doing em. Personally, I think the best way to learn something is when you do a project and you encounter a problem. Most people hate when that happens but for me, I take that as a learning experience.

#### Daily system
In terms of operating system I always use linux (I use arch btw). Yes, I'm one of those degen who use the almighty Arch Linux. At first I used Ubuntu for a solid 2 years. After some time, I learned that I have little to no control for the apps I installed. Plus, I hate installing applications in apt, why do i have to add keys manually. The reason I use Ubuntu and not other systems is because it's the most used linux operating system. After a bit of searching, it turns out another huge linux flavour that people use is Arch Linux and I fell in love at first sight.

Yes, I primarily do C++, use arch linux, and a network geek, whether i'm a furry/femboy, no comment.
